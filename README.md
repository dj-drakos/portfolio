TODOS:

- unmount intersection observers
- bugfix: useToggleFixedClass handleIntersect should only fire on intersect w/ top bounding rect
- convert social .pngs to svgs for responsiveness + to toggle color w/ theme
- change title prop to class name to state key name flow?
- fix performance issue with styled section: 
    ```
    Styled(Section) with the id of "sc-hLBbgP".
    Consider using the attrs method, together with a style object for frequently changed styles.
    Example:
      const Component = styled.div.attrs(props => ({
        style: {
          background: props.background,
        },
      }))'width: 100%;'
      ```

- why is the weather toggle disappearing on click?
